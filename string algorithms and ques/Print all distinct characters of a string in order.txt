(O(n) and requires one traversal)
The idea is to use two auxiliary arrays of size 256 (Assuming that characters are stored using 8 bits).

Initialize all values in count[] as 0 and all values in index[] as n where n is length of string.
Traverse the input string str and do following for every character c = str[i].
Increment count[x].
If count[x] is 1, then store index of x in index[x], i.e., index[x] = i
If count[x] is 2, then remove x from index[], i.e., index[x] = n
Now index[] has indexes of all distinct characters. Sort indexes and print characters using it. Note that this step takes O(1) time assuming number of characters are
 fixed (typically 256)

// C++ program to find all distinct characters 
// in a string 
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std; 
const int MAX_CHAR = 256; 

// Function to print distinct characters in 
// given string str[] 
void printDistinct(string str) 
{ 
	int n = str.length(); 

	// count[x] is going to store count of 
	// character 'x' in str. If x is not present, 
	// then it is going to store 0. 
	int count[MAX_CHAR]; 

	// index[x] is going to store index of character 
	// 'x' in str. If x is not present or x is 
	// more than once, then it is going to store a value 
	// (for example, length of string) that cannot be 
	// a valid index in str[] 
	int index[MAX_CHAR]; 

	// Initialize counts of all characters and indexes 
	// of distinct characters. 
	for (int i = 0; i < MAX_CHAR; i++) 
	{ 
		count[i] = 0; 
		index[i] = n; // A value more than any index 
					// in str[] 
	} 

	// Traverse the input string 
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
	{ 
		// Find current character and increment its 
		// count 
		char x = str[i]; 
		++count[x]; 

		// If this is first occurrence, then set value 
		// in index as index of it. 
		if (count[x] == 1 && x !=' ') 
			index[x] = i; 

		// If character repeats, then remove it from 
		// index[] 
		if (count[x] == 2) 
			index[x] = n; 
	} 

	// Since size of index is constant, below operations 
	// take constant time. 
	sort(index, index+MAX_CHAR); 
	for (int i=0; i<MAX_CHAR && index[i] != n; i++) 
	cout << str[index[i]]; 
} 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	string str = "GeeksforGeeks"; 
	printDistinct(str); 
	return 0; 
}
